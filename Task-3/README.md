Task 3: Control Flow Based Student Result System :-

📌 Overview
This task focuses on implementing a console-based Student Result Processing System using Java control flow statements.
The program accepts student marks, validates input, calculates percentage, assigns grades, and allows multiple student entries using loops.

🎯 Objectives

-> Understand if-else control flow
-> Use loops (while) for repeated execution
-> Apply break and continue
-> Perform input validation
-> Calculate percentage correctly 
-> Improve code readability and structure

📂 Program Features

Accepts student marks (integer or decimal)
Validates marks range (0–100)
Calculates percentage using formula
Assigns grade based on percentage
Allows multiple student entries
Exits gracefully on user choice

🧠 Core Concepts Used

Scanner for console input
while(true) loop
if-else conditions
continue for invalid input
break to exit loop
double for decimal precision
Clean variable naming and comments
